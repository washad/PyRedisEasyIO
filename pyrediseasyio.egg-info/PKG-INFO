Description: # PyRedisEasyIO
        A project to simplify reading/writing single objects from/to redis
        
        
        ## Description
        Redis is a great way to share data between applications - or processes in an application. 
        However, in its raw form, the application has to deal with data type conversion to/from
        string, check for existence, and other pesky stuff. It would be nice if that were 
        abstracted in such a way to where it didn't appear in code that redis was being used
        at all. 
        
        This project seeks to allow the exchange of single data points in a readable way, eg. 
        my_data.my_value = 30 (automatically writes '30' to redis) 
        
        ## Installation
        pip install pyrediseasyio
        
        
        ## Usage
        The basis of functionality is the IOGroup class. It acts as a container for individual values
        and performs the behind-the-scenes reads and writes.

        from io_group import IOGroup
        from single_io import BooleanIO, IntIO, FloatIO
        
        
        class TestGroup1(IOGroup):
            Bool1 = BooleanIO("Boolean 1", "Bool1", False)
            Bool2 = BooleanIO("Boolean 2", "Bool2", True)
            Int1 = IntIO("Integer 1", "Int1")
            Int2 = IntIO("Integer 2", "Int2", default=34)
            Float1 = FloatIO("Float 1", "Float1", default=1.2)
        
        class TestGroup2(IOGroup):
            Bool1 = BooleanIO("Boolean 1", "Bool1", False)
            Bool2 = BooleanIO("Boolean 2", "Bool2", True)
            Int1 = IntIO("Integer 1", "Int1")
            Int2 = IntIO("Integer 2", "Int2", default=34)
            Float1 = FloatIO("Float 1", "Float1", default=1.2)
           
        
        group1a = TestGroup1()
        group1b = TestGroup1()
        group2 = TestGroup2()
        
        group1a.Float1 = 1234.5
        print(group1b.Float1.value)
        print(group2.Float1.value)

        That is really all there is to it. For more specific cases, see the unit tests.
